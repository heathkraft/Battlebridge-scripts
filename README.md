# System setup
I'm writing this script to automate setup of a clean system install to my personalized configuration. 
Hopefully to include installation of version controlled dotfiles.
I'm also trying to write this in such a way that others can use it for their system installs, with relatively minor edits.

The more I have worked on this, the more I realize that my original plan for it is really just too much to ask. With differences in distributions, distro versions changing, updates to the many apps and dependencies, it's just too involved to make one script, and keep it up to date and functioning. So, I'm going to instead work out a few different scripts for myself to use for the various systems I manage.
