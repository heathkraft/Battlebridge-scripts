# deb-based-setup
I'm writing this script to automate setup of a clean Debian install to my personalized configuration. 
Hopefully to include installation of version controlled dotfiles.
I'm also trying to write this in such a way that others can use it for their Debian, or derivatives, installs, with relatively minor edits.
